title: "Deep Learning for Characterizing Sequence Reads"
excerpt: "In this research project, we show that using a deep learning based DNA language model we can achieve performance in sequence classification approaching the performance of standard mapping algorithms. The performance of our model was most comparable to the performance of mapping when the input sequences were mutated at a higher rate (0.1 snps per bp)."
