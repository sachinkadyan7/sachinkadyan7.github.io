I was a teaching assistant and instructor for the Natural Language Processing course taught by Prof. Yassine Benajiba during the Fall 2022 semester.

As an instructor, I planned and taught classes on Machine Learning, ML for NLP, Autoencoders, Convolutional NNs, Recurrent NNs, and attention-based networks.

As a teaching assistant, I guided and led in-class and online discussions, and graded assignments and exams.
