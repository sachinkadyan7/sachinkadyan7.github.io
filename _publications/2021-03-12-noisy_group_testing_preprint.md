*This paper is a preprint.*  

Here I study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modelling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. 
The main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework. 
The findings highlight the implications of introducing randomness to the infection vectors – that the combinatorial structure of the pooling designs plays a less important role than the parameters such as pool size and redundancy.
