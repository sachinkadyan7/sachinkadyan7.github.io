As part of the *Machine Learning on AWS for Life Sciences* talk at *AWS re:Invent 2022*, I talked about the growing importance of computational power and techniques in the advancement of biology. 

I focused on the problem of protein structure prediction, its importance, approaches, current advancements, and what comes (or is already coming) in the future.
