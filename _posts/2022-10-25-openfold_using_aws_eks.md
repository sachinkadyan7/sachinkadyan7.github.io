This blog post is a collaboration and is hosted on the AWS Machine Learning Blog.

The post focuses on
1. The importance of being able to run protein structure prediction through Openfold at scale.
2. Setting up an AWS EKS cluster and a distributed file system (Amazon FSx for Lustre) for running Openfold.
3. Using the EKS cluster to run Openfold alignment and structure prediction jobs in a distributed fashion.
