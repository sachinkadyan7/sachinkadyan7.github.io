Check out my notes [here](/notes/).

Hey Everyone!

I am Sachin, and I am a Computational Biologist who works at the intersection of Computer Science, Biology, and Machine Learning.

My aim is to learn the language of life by using Computer Science to understand biological systems from both holistic and reductionist perspectives. For too long we have asked questions about how biological systems are structured. With the explosion of data, and the advancement of computational algorithms and machine learning techniques, we finally have the capability to start answering these questions *in-silico*.

Currently I am focusing on proteins and their structures, but I have strong interests in many other areas areas as well :-
 1. Regulatory elements in biological pathways
 2. Effect of genomic variation
 3. Drug discovery and molecular design

In the long term, I wish to establish my own lab to research about the information-theoretic basis of biological systems.
